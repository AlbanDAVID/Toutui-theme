🤝 Thank you for sharing your theme!

Before creating a pull request to submit your theme, please read these guidelines:

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Toutui is under active development. New color variables may be added in future versions. If it happens, we encourage you to:
>  - Update the new color variables to keep your theme consistent.  
>  - Provide an updated screenshot if necessary.
> 
> Your theme contributions are always welcome, even at this early stage! 

1) Choose a clear and original name for your theme.
2) If your theme is inspired by the Dracula color palette, give it a name who is not still referenced in the readme (e.g. Dracula2, Dracula3, etc.).
3) In the `theme/` folder, add your theme config file as `name_of_your_theme.toml`.
4) You must keep the default comments (e.g. do not remove lines like `# General background color of the app:`).
5) Obviously, you must keep the same variable names as the original config file. You just have to modify RGB colors.
6) In the README:

    6.1 Add your theme’s name, and optionaly your username, and a link to the file.

    Example:  
    ```
    ### [Name_of_your_theme by username (optional)](https://github.com/AlbanDAVID/Toutui-theme/blob/main/themes/name_of_your_theme.toml
    ```
    6.2 Add a screenshot:
   
      a) You can take a screenshot from `Continue listening` or `Library` view.

      b) Only start the screenshot from `Continue listening` or `Library` (your server address or username must not appear).
   
      c) Show the player
   
      d) Hide the player shortcuts (by pressing `Shit+b`)
   
      e) Show the search bar (by pressing `/`)  
    
9) When can a theme will not be directly accepted?
   - No respect of above guidlines.
   - If the color association is visually inconsistent.  
   - If the name is not appropriate or already used.
  
That's all 🙂
Thank you for contributing!
